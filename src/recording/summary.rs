//! Summaries and titles of transcribed recordings: `[recording] summary`
//! (after each transcript) and `whisrs recording summarize` (on demand),
//! through the `[llm]` command mode uses.
//!
//! The transcript goes to the LLM as timed lines of one speaker
//! ([`transcript_lines`]), framed as data whose speaker labels can be wrong.
//! A transcript of [`MIN_WORDS`] words or fewer is not sent: its summary is
//! [`TOO_SHORT`]. One that fits in [`PART_CHARS`] is summarized in one call.
//! A longer one is split between lines into at most [`MAX_PARTS`] parts
//! ([`split_parts`]), each part is turned into notes with the same rules,
//! and one last call turns the notes into the summary; a call that fails
//! ends the summary. The call that writes the summary also gives a title
//! when the recording has none of the user's
//! ([`RecordingMeta::title_source`]). Whatever fails is noted in
//! `recording.json` `errors` and never fails the recording. In the daemon a
//! summary is a job of its own, after the transcript.
