# whisrs — Project Conventions

## Environment

- OS: Arch Linux
- Shell: fish (no `&&` chaining — use `;` instead; no `export`, use `set -x`)
- Editor: nvim
- Python: managed with `uv` (not pip)
- Rust: managed with `cargo`

## Build Commands

```fish
cargo build                                    # compile debug binaries (includes all backends)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings      # lint (strict, warnings = errors)
cargo test                                     # run all tests
cargo fmt                                      # format code
cargo fmt -- --check                           # check formatting (CI)
```

## Running

```fish
# First-time setup (interactive, no daemon needed)
whisrs setup

# Start the daemon
whisrsd &
# Or via systemd
systemctl --user enable --now whisrs.service

# Use the CLI (bind to a hotkey)
whisrs toggle    # start/stop dictation
whisrs cancel    # cancel and discard audio
whisrs speak     # read the selected text aloud via TTS (alias: read; press again to stop)
whisrs status    # query daemon state
whisrs restart   # restart the daemon (wraps systemctl --user when present)
whisrs command   # record a voice instruction, rewrite the selection via LLM
whisrs log       # dictation history
whisrs config    # interactive config editor
whisrs recording start [-t TITLE] [--shared-mic] [--num-speakers N] [--with "Sarah, Omar"] | stop | toggle | cancel | status   # record mic + system audio, transcribe after the stop
whisrs recording list | show <id|last> [-f md|json|txt] | path <id> | copy <id> | retry <id> [--with "..."]
whisrs recording name <id> <S2|"Speaker 2"|current name> <name>   # "" clears; rewrites the .md at once
whisrs recording summarize <id>   # [llm] summary (+ title if untitled) via the queue; [recording] summary = true does it after each transcript

# Dev loop: rebuild this checkout and restart the daemon
./scripts/dev-install.sh             # build + install to ~/.cargo/bin + restart
./scripts/dev-install.sh --system    # build + sudo install to /usr/local/bin + restart

# Debug logging
set -x RUST_LOG debug; whisrsd
```

## Project Structure

Cargo workspace: the root package builds two binaries, plus five extracted crates.

Injection **policy** lives in the daemon: `type_text_at_cursor`, `paste_via_keyboard`
and `inject_text` (all in `src/daemon/main.rs`) decide what gets sent.
The **primitives** they call live in the `xkb-type` workspace crate, not in `src/`:

```
crates/
├── xkb-type/src/           # 0.1.4 — key injection
│   ├── lib.rs              #   KeyInjector + ClipboardBackend traits
│   ├── keyboard.rs         #   uinput virtual keyboard (evdev)
│   ├── keymap.rs           #   XKB reverse lookup (char → keycode+modifiers)
│   ├── clipboard.rs        #   Clipboard ops (wl-copy/arboard, save/restore)
│   └── wayland_vk.rs       #   zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1 backend
├── asr-dedup/              # 0.1.0 — timestamp + n-gram dedup for chunked ASR
├── audio-silence-gate/     # 0.1.0 — RMS energy gate / VAD
├── filler-remove/          # 0.1.0 — filler-word stripping
└── prompt-echo/            # 0.1.0 — prompt-echo hallucination filter
```

Workspace crates use path + version deps. `cargo publish` strips the path and resolves
from crates.io, so **a changed crate must be bumped and published before whisrs is**.

`specs/` holds tracked per-feature design docs (e.g.
`specs/openai-compatible-realtime/{DESIGN,README,TASKS}.md`).

**Note on `docs/`:** `/docs/*` is gitignored with a five-file whitelist. Only
`comparison.md`, `configuration.md`, `faq.md`, `troubleshooting.md` and
`version-roadmap.md` are tracked. Everything else there is local-only, so "fixing the
docs" in an untracked file changes nothing for users and shows up in no PR. Check with
`git check-ignore -v <path>` before claiming a docs fix landed.

## Feature Flags

- `default = ["local-whisper", "tray", "overlay", "hooks"]`
- `local-whisper` — whisper-rs (whisper.cpp) for offline transcription. Requires a C++ toolchain and libclang.
- `tray` — tray icon via `ksni`
- `overlay` — recording overlay via `smithay-client-toolkit` + `wayland-client` + `tiny-skia`
- `hooks` — recording-lifecycle hooks + MPRIS media pause via `zbus` (no new system dep; `overlay` already pulls `zbus`)
- `vulkan` / `cuda` / `hipblas` — GPU backends for the bundled whisper.cpp, passed
  through to `whisper-rs`. Each implies `local-whisper`. Off by default and never built
  by CI or the release workflow, so they are source-build-only (`cargo install whisrs
  --features vulkan`). Enabling one turns on whisper-rs's `_gpu`, which is what flips
  `WhisperContextParameters::default().use_gpu` to true — there is no whisrs-side wiring.

The **minimal** release build is `--no-default-features --features tray,overlay,hooks`:
it drops only whisper.cpp. Keep `tray`, `overlay` and `hooks` in it (that omission was
issue #51). A feature left out of that list is silently ignored at runtime rather than
diagnosed: `Config` is not feature-gated, so the key still parses as known and the
unknown-key warning stays quiet.

## Coding Conventions

- Use `thiserror` for library-level error types (`WhisrsError` in `src/lib.rs`)
- Use `anyhow` for application-level errors (in binary crates and setup flow)
- Use `tracing` for all logging (not `println!` or `log`). CLI may use `println!` for user output.
- Serde for all serialization: JSON for IPC, TOML for config
- Length-prefixed JSON over Unix socket for IPC (4-byte big-endian length + JSON body)
- All platform-specific behavior behind traits (`KeyInjector`, `WindowTracker`, `ClipboardBackend`)
- **A trait method with a useful default is a trap. Prefer a required method, or check every implementor.** Case study: `WindowTracker::get_focused_window_class()` defaulted to `None` and only Hyprland and Niri overrode it, so `is_terminal` was silently false on KDE, GNOME, Sway and X11 until #71. The method is required now, Sway and X11 implement it, and KDE/GNOME return an explicit `None` (GNOME needs a shell extension, issue #72; KDE would need `org_kde_plasma_window_management`, issue #127), so a new tracker cannot inherit the gap without a compile error.
- **Wire new features into both transcription paths.** A feature added only to `run_streaming_pipeline` silently no-ops for batch backends (`groq`, `openai`/`deepgram` REST, `asr-sidecar`). This shipped as a bug in #54.
- Config structs derive both `Serialize` and `Deserialize` for read/write

## IPC Protocol

Socket: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/whisrs.sock` (fallback: `/tmp/whisrs-<uid>.sock`)

Commands (`Command` in `src/lib.rs`, tagged by `cmd`):

```json
{"cmd": "toggle"}                    // optional "language" overrides general.language for one session
{"cmd": "cancel"}
{"cmd": "status"}
{"cmd": "log", "limit": 20}
{"cmd": "clear-history"}
{"cmd": "command"}                   // command mode: selection → voice instruction → LLM rewrite
{"cmd": "speak"}                     // alias: "read". Repeat or cancel stops playback.
{"cmd": "recording", "action": "start|stop|cancel|status|toggle|retry|copy|name|summarize", "title": "...", "id": "...",
 "language": "de", "mic_language": "de", "system_language": "auto", "others": "Video",
 "shared_mic": true, "num_speakers": 3, "participants": ["Sarah", "Omar"],
 "speaker": "S2", "name": "Sarah"}
                                     // all but action optional: title (start/toggle), id (retry/copy/name/summarize,
                                     // default "last"), speaker + name (name; "" clears), the languages, shared_mic, num_speakers and
                                     // participants (--with) (start/toggle/retry;
                                     // a track's own language wins over "language"), others = system track
                                     // label (start/toggle). Validated by the daemon
                                     // (RecordingOptions::validated)
```

Responses: `{"status": "ok", "state": "idle"}`, `{"status": "error", "message": "..."}`,
a `History` variant carrying log entries, and a `Recording` variant carrying the recording status.

Adding a command means a new `Command` variant plus a daemon handler. Never put logic in
`src/cli/main.rs`: it is a thin socket client. One read-only exception: `whisrs recording
list/show/path` read the recordings folder directly, which keeps transcript bodies off IPC
(as does the speaker list `whisrs recording name` prints after the daemon renamed one).

## Configuration

Path: `~/.config/whisrs/config.toml` (permissions: 0600)

Transcription backends: `deepgram`, `deepgram-streaming`, `groq`, `openai-realtime`, `openai-compatible-realtime`, `openai`, `local-whisper`, `local-vosk`, `local-parakeet`, `asr-sidecar`

TTS (read selection aloud): the `[tts]` section (`enabled` off by default) drives `whisrs speak` / `read` and `[hotkeys] speak`. Backends: `groq`, `openai`, `deepgram`, `tts-sidecar` (local OpenAI-compatible server, alias `openai-compat`). The TTS key falls back to the matching transcription key (`[groq]`/`[openai]`/`[deepgram]`) unless `[tts] api_key` is set; `tts-sidecar` needs none.

Word replacements: the top-level `[replacements]` table (`"package build" = "PKGBUILD"`) rewrites every dictation on both paths, and every recording transcript segment, after filler removal (`src/replacements.rs`).

Recording (mic + system audio, transcribed after the stop): the `[recording]` section (`backend`,
`user_name`, `language`, `mic_language`, `system_language`, `mic_device`, `system_device`,
`max_duration_minutes`, `audio_retention_days`, `dir`, `diarization`, `diarization_url`,
`num_speakers`, `shared_mic`, `name_speakers`, `summary`, `summary_instruction`)
plus `[hotkeys] recording`. Recordings live in `~/.local/share/whisrs/recordings/<id>/`
(`recording.json`, `<id>.md`, `audio/`, and a `.cache/` of finished chunks kept until the
transcript is written or the audio is deleted; a diarization sidecar's voices stay until the
audio is deleted). The recording backend
must be file-capable, a backend that can transcribe a recorded file: groq, openai, deepgram,
asr-sidecar or local-whisper (`deepgram-streaming` maps to `deepgram`; realtime backends are
refused). Every processing job goes through one queue in `daemon/recording.rs` (`reserve` +
`dispatch`; a `Job` is `Transcribe` or `Summarize`); short rewrites that are no job (`recording
name`, the retention sweep) `hold`/`release` the recording instead. A summary never re-transcribes:
it re-renders `<id>.md` from `recording.json` (`process::save`), as `recording name` does.

Environment variable overrides:
- `WHISRS_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` — overrides `[deepgram] api_key` (also used by the `deepgram` TTS backend)
- `WHISRS_GROQ_API_KEY` — overrides `[groq] api_key` (also used by the `groq` TTS backend)
- `WHISRS_OPENAI_API_KEY` — overrides `[openai] api_key` (also used by the `openai` TTS backend)
- `WHISRS_ASR_SIDECAR_API_KEY` — overrides `[asr-sidecar] api_key` (optional bearer token for authenticated sidecar endpoints)
- `RUST_LOG` — controls daemon log verbosity

## CI Checks

**IMPORTANT: Never push without running all CI checks locally first.** Failing CI generates error emails and clutters the commit history with fix-up commits. Always run these before pushing:

```fish
cargo fmt                                      # fix formatting
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings      # lint (must pass clean)
cargo test                                     # all tests must pass
cargo build                                    # must compile
```

If any check fails, fix the issue before pushing. Do not push with the intent to "fix it in the next commit".

**IMPORTANT: Always commit `Cargo.lock` alongside `Cargo.toml` changes.** The root package ships binaries, so `Cargo.lock` is tracked: it makes builds reproducible and is required for `cargo install --locked`. Every commit that modifies dependencies must include the updated lock file.

## Releasing a New Version

When a feature or set of changes warrants a version bump:

0. **Workspace crates first.** If anything under `crates/` changed since the last tag
   (`git log --oneline <last-tag>..HEAD -- crates/`), bump that crate's own version, and
   the root `Cargo.toml` requirement too if the bump falls outside it. Publish those
   crates to crates.io **before** whisrs: `cargo publish` strips the path dep and
   verifies against crates.io, so an unpublished change fails the whisrs publish.
1. **Bump version** in `Cargo.toml`, `flake.nix`, and the `.TH` lines of `contrib/whisrs.1` and `contrib/whisrsd.1` (semver: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). `cargo test` fails if the man page versions are stale, but the revision date in the same `.TH` line is only checked by eye — bump it too.
2. **Always include `Cargo.lock`** in the version bump commit
3. **Run all CI checks** locally (see above)
4. **Commit** and **push**
5. **Tag and release on GitHub**: `git tag v<VERSION>; git push origin v<VERSION>`, then create a GitHub release with `gh release create v<VERSION>` including release notes summarizing the changes
6. **Publish to crates.io**: Always run `cargo publish` after pushing a version bump — do not skip this step
7. **Update `whisrs-bin`** in its own repo (not this one): bump `pkgver` in the `PKGBUILD`, refresh both `sha256sums_x86_64` and `sha256sums_aarch64` against the new release tarballs, regenerate `.SRCINFO` with `makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO`, commit, and push to AUR. Do it **after** step 5, since the assets do not exist until the release workflow finishes.
   **Never bump `whisrs-git` for a release.** It builds `main` HEAD and `pkgver()` derives the version at build time, and the AUR rules forbid pkgver-only commits on VCS packages. The per-release bumps also made it look tag-pinned on the AUR page. Push to it only when the build itself changes (deps, flags, installed files)

## Packaging

Packaging files (AUR PKGBUILD, etc.) do NOT belong in this repo. They are maintained externally:
- **AUR**: two packages we maintain locally and push via `makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO; git push`
  - `whisrs-bin` (`~/Projects/whisrs-bin/`) — prebuilt release tarballs, pinned to a tag. The recommended install
  - `whisrs-git` (`~/Projects/whisrs-git/`) — builds from `main` HEAD, no tag pin. Not bumped on release (see step 7)
  - Not ours: graysky maintains the `whisrs` split package (`whisrs`, `whisrs-cuda`, `whisrs-vulkan`), which compiles the tagged release source. Its CUDA and Vulkan flavors are the only packaged GPU builds
- **Nix**: `flake.nix` lives in-repo (standard practice for Nix projects)
- **crates.io**: `cargo publish` manually after version bump

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
